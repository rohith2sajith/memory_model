Effects of Alzheimer’s Disease on Temporal Difference Learning and Successor Representation Models for Hippocampus Pathfinding.

Since the discovery of neurodegenerative disease, intense attention has been given to identifying the structures most damaged with disease progression. Specifically, Alzheimer’s disease detrimentally affects the hippocampus region of the brain that plays a key role in navigation and memory function, potentially by damaging synaptic connections between CA3 cells and CA1 cells. 

Moreover, recent medical research has indicated that lapses in spatial navigation is a crucial symptom in preclinical Alzhiemer’s. Therefore, predictable models with respect to pathfinding that reflect the development of the disease can be
central during treatment. 

This python program is created to study two computational models- the temporal difference learning method and the successor representation - for hippocampus pathfinding and weigh their advantages and deficiencies in describing navigation through a two dimensional maze. After the construction of these models, we strive to predict the effects of Alzheimer’s on pathfinding by applying both random and systematic synaptic damage to the both representations, corresponding to discrepancies in synaptic firing rates. We find a pronounced and quantifiably predictable impact on the post-damage navigation.
